## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `customtkinter`
  - `psutil`
  - `win32com.client`
  - `Pillow`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Trukitro/DiskInfo.git
   cd DiskInfo
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
- **On Windows:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   python DiskInfov5.py
   ```
5. (Optional) Build the .exe file:
- **If you want to create a standalone executable file, use PyInstaller:**
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   pyinstaller --onefile DiskInfov5.py
   ```
- **The .exe file will be located in the dist folder.**

## Executable Version

### Overview
The `.exe` version of DiskInfo allows you to run the application without needing to install Python or any dependencies. It is a standalone executable file that simplifies usage for non-technical users.

### Benefits
- **No Dependencies**: No need to install Python or additional libraries.
- **Portable**: Can be run directly on any Windows machine.
- **Easy to Share**: Distribute the `.exe` file to others without requiring them to set up a Python environment.

### How to Use
1. **Download**:
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Trukitro/DiskInfo/releases) section of the GitHub repository.
   - Download the latest `.exe` file (e.g., `DiskInfo.exe`).

2. **Run**:
   - Double-click the `.exe` file to launch the application.

3. **Bypass Windows SmartScreen Warning**:
   If you see the "Windows protected your PC" warning:
   - Click **More Info**.
   - Click **Run Anyway** to proceed.

4. **Explore Features**:
   - Use the navigation sidebar to access the following features:
     - **Drive Info**: Displays basic information about connected drives.
     - **Health Status**: Monitors the health of your drives.
     - **Partitions**: Provides detailed partition information.
     - **Benchmark**: Tests the read/write speeds of your drives.

### Notes
- The `.exe` file is built using **PyInstaller**, which packages the Python application into a standalone executable.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the file on your system.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Example
Hereâ€™s how the `.exe` file might look when running on a Windows system:

```plaintext
C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads> DiskInfo.exe
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - If you encounter an error about missing libraries, ensure you have installed all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

     ```
2. **Windows SmartScreen Warning**:
   - If you see the "Windows protected your PC" warning when running the `.exe` file:
     1. Click **More Info**.
     2. Click **Run Anyway** to proceed.
   - This warning appears because the `.exe` file is not signed with a trusted code signing certificate. It is safe to run if you downloaded it from the official [Releases](https://github.com/Trukitro/DiskInfo/releases) page.


3. **Permission Denied Errors**:
   - Run the application as an administrator if you encounter permission issues accessing certain drives.

4. **SMART Data Not Available**:
   - Some drives may not support SMART data. Check your drive's specifications.

5. **Benchmark Errors**:
   - Ensure the drive is writable and has sufficient free space for the benchmark test.

If you encounter other issues, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Trukitro/DiskInfo/issues).
